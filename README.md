This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).

* This is **our sample project for Software Engineering (SE) students**.<br>
* It is named New Address book because we want to help secondary school teachers manage contacts in **rapidly merging schools**.
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _AddressBook_) used for managing contact details.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* It is named `AddressBook Level 3` (`AB3` for short) because it was initially created as a part of a series of `AddressBook` projects (`Level 1`, `Level 2`, `Level 3` ...).
